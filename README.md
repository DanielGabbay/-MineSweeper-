About the game:
> Minesweeper is a popular board game shipped with many operating systems by default.
> The goal of the game is to sweep all mines from a minefield. If the player clicks on the cell which contains a mine, the mine detonates and the game is over.
> A cell can contain a number or it can be blank. The number indicates how many mines are adjacent to this particular cell. 
🚩 We set a flag on a cell by right-clicking on it. This way we indicate that we believe, there is a mine.
